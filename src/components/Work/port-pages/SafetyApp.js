                                <p>The UCLan Wellbeing Department were looking for a personal safety mobile application for use both on and off-campus to support students when dealing with a range of issues ranging from mental health to live crisis support. </p>
                                <p>The goal was to create a prototype to open the discussion of the University pursuing the further development of the application.</p>

                            The Problem
                        </div>
                        <p>In the brief provided by the Wellbeing department were the features that they wanted to be incorporated, they provided twelve unique features with no preference of importance. As we were designing a mobile application, we knew we wouldn’t be able to provide each requested feature with the same priority, meaning we needed to work out which features ranked most important to users, would be used the most or needed to be accessed the quickest. </p>
                        <p>At the time in which the project was commissioned the Universities support information and contact details were spread out over multiple sections on the website finding it hard to locate specific resources for individuals’ issues. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="item-section">

                            The Solution
                        </div>
                        <p>At the outset of the project, we discussed each other’s strengths and delegated roles within the group. Based upon this discussion I became the project lead and in charge of user testing, wireframes, and prototyping. </p>
                        <p>My next task was to create initial wireframes. As a group we brainstormed and created paper wireframes from which I recreated digitally. </p>
                        <img src="../../images/workImages/wellbeingImages/paperWF.webp" alt="" />
                        <p>From the low fidelity wireframes, I created medium fidelity wireframes and a basic prototype.</p>
                        <img src="../../images/workImages/wellbeingImages/wireframes2.webp" alt="" />
                        <p>From the wireframes I then used InVision Studio to create a lightweight working prototype that was accessible on mobile devices.</p>
                        <p>We then attempted to establish a focus group but had very poor attendance. As students ourselves we knew what students liked so reworked our testing approach and instead went with a gorilla UX style. We approached students in the student hub and offered Starbucks vouchers in exchange for their time to test the prototype.  </p>
                        <p>From this testing we were able to gauge what students both liked and disliked and observed points in which users struggled or used the application unexpectedly.</p>
                        <p>After repeating the process, several times, and making changes based on each set of results, we designed and created a prototype ready to present to the wellbeing department.</p>

                            Results
                        </div>
                        <p>The result of the project was a working prototype that included the most important features based on user feedback. The prototype has a clear layout that allows users to effectively navigate the application. It uses both sizing and colour to communicate the importance of the different features.</p>
                        <p>To conclude the project can be seen as a success, as we received positive feedback from the client and ensured us that they liked the direction it was going. The prototype also includes most of the requested features and incorporated users’ feedback throughout the development process.</p>
